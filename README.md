# Cumulus

A personal learning project for building game engine-like applications.

## Overview

Cumulus is a work-in-progress experimental project created to explore and learn the fundamentals of building game engines and interactive applications. The project integrates several powerful libraries to handle graphics, UI, and scripting.

## Tech Stack

- **SDL3 & SDL_GPU** – Cross-platform window management and GPU-accelerated rendering
- **Nuklear** – Immediate-mode GUI library for building user interfaces
- **Lua** – Embedded scripting language via C integration

## Building

```bash
./build.sh
```

Or manually with CMake:

```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Status

🚧 **Work in Progress** – This project is in active development and may evolve in unexpected directions. It might eventually be used as a foundation for developing other applications.

## License

This is a personal learning project.
